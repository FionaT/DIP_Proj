Two-Dimensional Fast Fourier Transform
-------------------

proj_04-01-a.py
---------------
Multiply the input image by (-1)x+y to center the transform for filtering.


proj_04-01-b.py
---------------
Multiply the resulting (complex) array by a real filter function (in the 

sense that the real coefficients multiply both the real and imaginary parts 

of the transforms). Recall that multiplication of two images is done on pairs 

of corresponding elements.

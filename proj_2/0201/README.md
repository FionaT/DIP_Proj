---------------
Write a halftoning computer program for printing gray-scale images 

based on the dot patterns just discussed. Your program must be able 

to scale the size of an input image so that it does not exceed the 

area available in a sheet of size 8.5 x 11 inches (21.6 x 27.9 cm). 

Your program must also scale the gray levels of the input image to 

span the full halftoning range.

of a gray scale wedge of size 256 x 256, whose first column 

is all 0's, the next column is all 1's, and so on, with the 

last column being 255's. 

Print this image using your gray-scale printing program.

---------------
Print book Figs. 2.22(a) through (c) using your gray-scale 

printing program. Do your results agree with the conclusions 

arrived at in the text in pgs. 64-65 and Fig. 2.23? Explain. 

You can download the required figures from the book web site.

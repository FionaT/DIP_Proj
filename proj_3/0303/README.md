Spatial Filtering
===============

proj_03-03-a.py:
---------------
Write program to perform spatial filtering of an image (see Section 3.4 regarding implementation).

Here I choose to blur the image by the average algorithm instead of Section 3.4' implementation

You can fix the size of the spatial mask at 3 x 3, but the coefficients need to be variables that can 

be input into your program. This project is generic, in the sense that it will be used in other projects

to follow.
